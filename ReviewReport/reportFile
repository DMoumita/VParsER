Regression report (PASS / FAIL) did not contain BitVector testcases (was not running earlier) since 
your regression script expects files with .sv extension only


BitVector-0: No error from Cheetah, vper produces error
NegNet-1: No error from Cheetah, vper produces error
NegReg-2: No error from Cheetah, vper produces error


Regression Failures: Gold files updated for the following:
   1) ContAssgn-2/contAssgn-2.sv:FAIL
   2) ContAssgn-3/contAssgn-3.sv:FAIL
   3) ContAssgn-4/contAssgn-4.sv:FAIL
   4) half-adder/half-adder.sv:FAIL

full-adder: Still producing garbage in the instantiations

Net-9: Why does vper decompile, given that this is an error? Move this to negative testcases
Net-10: decompiled output from vper does not compile with Cheetah (see cheetahLogonVperGen1)
Net-11: Why does vper decompile, given that this is an error? Move this to negative testcases
Net-13: Why does vper decompile, given that this is an error? Move this to negative testcases
Net-14: decompiled output from vper does not compile with Cheetah (see cheetahLogonVperGen1)

Port-0: Cheetah gives error, while vper does not (See cheetah Error log cheetahLog1)
